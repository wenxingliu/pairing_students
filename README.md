This is a project developed to support the Online E-pal/Tutoring For Students In China Program.

This E-pal program is an initiative to connect Chinese kids in the US and kids in China, during this COVID-19(Coronavirus) outbreak.

The program provides students in Hubei Provice, and daughters/sons of doctors and nurses who are at the front line to fight the virus. Together, we are strong.
