# Pairing Tutor-Student

This project is developed to support the **Online E-pal/Tutoring For Students In China Program** initiated by *Communities Without Boundaries Foundation (Kansas)*.

This E-pal program is an initiative to connect Chinese kids in the US and kids in China during this COVID-19 (Coronavirus) outbreak.

Thousands of Chinese doctors and nurses left their families, fight day and night at the front line of the war with COVID-19 to save lives. They got our backs, and we should do the same.

The program provides kids in Hubei Provice, especially the ones from medical professional families, opportunities to connect with new friends while quarantined at home during the outbreak. 

Together, we fight COVID-19.
